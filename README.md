gulp-sample
============

Messing around with gulp and node.

If you haven't already:
```
brew install node
```

Otherwise, you can download and install from [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).

### Install Gulp Globally
Gulp must be installed globally in order to use the command line tools.
(might need sudo)
```
npm install -g gulp
```

### Install Compass (if you haven't already)
The gulp-compass module relies on Compass already being installed on your system.
```
gem update --system
gem install compass
```
### Install npm dependencies
(might need sudo)
```
npm install
```

### Run gulp
```
gulp
```
